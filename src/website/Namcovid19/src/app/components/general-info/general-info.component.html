      <h3>What is <span>Coronavirus</span>?</h3>
      <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
        (SARS-CoV).<br>
        <br> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously
        identified in humans.<br>
        <br>
        Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations
        found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
        Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. <br>
        <br>
        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing
        difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney
        failure and even death.<br>
        <br>
        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when
        coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of
        respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

    <h3>How does it <span>spread</span>?</h3><br>
    <h4><span>Person-to-person spread</span></h4>
    <p>
      The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
      <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Can someone spread the virus without being sick?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).</li>
      <li>Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this
        new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="clr"></div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <h4><span>Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects</span></h4>
      <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
        then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the
        virus spreads.</p>
    </div><br>
    <h4>How easily the virus spreads</h4>
    <p>How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily),
      like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained,
      spreading continually without stopping.

      The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”)
      in some affected geographic areas.</p>

    <h3>Common <span>Symptoms</span></h3>
    <h4>Watch for symptoms</h4>
    <p>Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19) cases.
      <br>
      The following symptoms may appear <strong>2-14 days after exposure.*</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Cough</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses.</p>

    <h3>Vaccine and <span>Treatment</span></h3>
    <h4>Know How it Spreads</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
      <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
      <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
        <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
